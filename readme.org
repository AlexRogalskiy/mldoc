* ml-org-parser
  Another Org-mode parser implemented using OCaml and [[https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom][Angstrom]].
  Don't use it right now, it's just a hobby project.

  It's based on [[http://iso.mor.phis.me/projects/mlorg/][mlorg]] which is a high quality Org-mode parser written by [[https://github.com/asmanur?tab=repositories][Simon Castellan]].
